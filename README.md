**Q**: We want to implement Q learning and deep Q learning (maybe compare them?). Is this a good idea, or would focusing on one solution would be better? If so, which solution to focus on?
**A**: We should implement one algorithm as the main thing, and then we can do another algorithm (compare the results, explain differences) for the bonus point. However, DQN and QL would not be a good comparison, as they are very similar.    
    
**Q** If we decide on writing a NN, can we use Keras?
**A** Yeah there is no restrictions in terms of libraries.
