# File overview
1.mazeEnv.py - In this file we define the maze environment in a class with the outlined layout of the maze.
2.utils.py - In this file we define all necessary functions for rendering the episodes and visualising the data about simulations.
3.Q-learning.py - In this file we define the logic behind Q-learning agent behaviour, contained in one class "QLearningAgentModified" and include the script for testing the agent in a given maze.
4.Reinforce.py - In this file we define the logic behind Reinforce agent behaviour, contained in one class "REINFORCEAgentOptimized", definition of softmax function and include  the script for testing the agent in a given maze.



# Running the files
For the overview of agents performance you can run the files Q-learning.py and Reinforce.py respectively. Both files contain a script at the end which
